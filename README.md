# 🏠 Home Automation Dashboard

This project is a **static HTML-based dashboard** that simulates a smart home control interface. It allows users to visualize the status of devices and sensors in a home environment and represents how basic automation systems work. Ideal for demonstration, educational use, or prototyping UI concepts.
